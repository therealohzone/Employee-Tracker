## Description

The following application is a command-line application that prompts a user with a series of choices. These choices allow a user to add, view, update, and delete departments, roles, and employees. In order to use this application, a user would navigate to the root directory and type the following command in the terminal:
npm install
node server.js
The user will then be prompted with a list of choices. Depending on the choice, the user will be prompted with a series of questions asking what they would like to do. After answering all of the questions, the application will respond by updating the employee database.
